              <p>
                This is based on constructions you might do in geometry. This is a very good game, as it allows for lots of fun things. 
                It has an infitely large worspace, and can actually handle large numbers of points, just don't go too far with it.
                <br />
                CIRCLE TOOL: Click on one point to set the center of the circle, then click on another to set the radius. <br />
                LINE TOOL: Connect two points with a line. <br />
                REMOVE CIRCLES: Remove all the circles attached to one point. <br />
                REMOVE POINT: Delete a point, also removes all circles and lines attached to that point. <br />
                CREATE POINT: Creates a point wherever you click. <br />

                WASD to move, and have fun!

                I made a half finished casino game. It currently has fully functional black jack and loans. 
                You can change your bet amount, and change what kind of loans you get, but they do not have good interest rates.
                Black jack is missing a few features, such as splitting, but other than that it works wondefully.
                There are also random encounters, which can give you special rewards.

                This was just another attempt to render 3d objects. any object that is behind you still gets rendered because of how negative values are handled.

              <p>
                This is an attempt at a 2D clone of slime rancher. I wanted to make a game where everything was a box in an array, and I think it works.
                I do believe it is very unoptimized, but that is okay. It is pretty cool I think, but a bit boring. Move with WASD, start vacuuming with V, stop with B.

                Because I did not know how to make it well, I tried to simplify it, and make the map 2D, but look 3D. 
                This was one of many attempts to do this, but the walls always curved and looked wierd.
                Despite how bad this looks, I believe this is the best one I made.

                It was fun to make, and I love the concept, but it goes over itself and because it repeats forever, it just is no fun.

              <p>
                This was the first game jam that I ever did. Our team made the project in Unity, but we had some issues with the submission. 
                In the end, it was fine and I learned a lot from this experience. It taught me how to be a better programmer and how to work under pressure. 
                I knew that I would be unable to make the project as well as I wanted, but it was okay. We ended up with a gameboard type game that was not too bad.
                We uploaded the project to itch <a href='https://lbaldwin26.itch.io/minute-party' target='_blank'>here</a>.

                We made two minigolf holes for this game jam, one was more professional, and one was all about the theming. It was quite enjoyable. 
                You can play both at <a href='https://neals.8thwall.app/golf-for-money' target='_blank'>this website</a>.
                The first 2 holes were not created by us, but the last 2 were.

                The 'Enehana Computer Science Club ran a game jam. For our game, we made a platformer where you have to avoid cannon balls and spike as a beach ball to collect a key. 
                If you can survive to unlock the treasure chest, then you become a rocket, and must avoid the octo-guards in the cave blocking the ending.
                You can play the game at <a href='https://8th.io/46krt' target='_blank'>this website</a>.

                Multiple people asked me for a small dainty ring made out of brass, so I made a few.

                This was an upgrade to the first simple ring I made. It uses an extra thick piece of brass.
                The outside truly was polished a lot, but the jewelry guard covers that up. The edges are not sanded.

                I had heard about inlay rings, and I wanted to test them out, but only quickly without too much effort.
                This resulted in me using scrap metal, so the result looks really bad. Personally, I do not hate it as much as it looks bad.

                For Christmas, I made my mother a silver signet ring with a pink gemstone bezel set on top. 
                Personally, I think this thing looks fantastic.

                I wanted to make this, because I thought it would be epic. I wanted to have something to play with in class, because class can be boring, and spinning rings are fun. 
                I was sort of inspired by the <a href='/portfolio/time-turner-inspiration.webp' target="_blank">time turner</a> from <em>Harry Potter</em>, but I did come up with most of this on my own.
                It was my idea and my work that made it come to reality.

                For my grandmother, I made a silver chicken ring with a ruby in a prong setting. She loves chickens so I made the entire ring into a chicken sitting on your finger.
                In front and behing the chicken are two roses, because they are my grandmother's favortite flower. Her birthstone is a ruby, so there is a large ruby prong set in the center of the chicken.
                This was a very fun project, and carved out of hard wax. It taught me patience and how to carve hard wax. I like the way it turned out, but many people could not recognize it as a chicken.
