         <p>
            This page is to show projects I made in p5.js.
            I learned this after I began taking a course.
            Later I quit this course, but continued to learn.
            I made a few projects, not really following what I was supposed to be doing in the class.
            They are in no real order.

               <h3>the casino</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/bcexsFo2E"></iframe>
               <p>
                     This is probably one of my favorite games I have made. 
                     It is a casino, though currently it only has one game, blackjack.
                     You can take out outrageous loans, pay them back, win money, randomly encounter people, and more.
                     There is a small debug menu, and you can type. 
                     There are multiple softlocks right now, first, playing cave dice. There is no way to win or lose, so it goes on forever.
                     Second, ecountering Derek the Violent Vendor, also known as Derek the Dealer.
                     I will fix these soon.

               <h3>the chessboard</h3>
               <iframe style="width: 450px; height: 492px; " src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/stjDbBcDg"></iframe>
               <p>
                     This is what you would expect, just a chessboard.
                     The pieces are all accounted for and have a way to render them at any square. 
                     The pieces, however, cannot move, so it is entirely non-functional.
               </p>
   
               <h3>the connect four board</h3>
               <iframe style="width: 350px; height: 342px; " src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/yvzwCrSN4"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This is probably the closest to a finished game I have, even though it is really unpolished and bad.
                  The placing rules are all set, and it alternates who places each token. 
                  It is unable to detect a victory, and the game will never end until every space is filled up.
                  It is basically a very unpolished game.
               </p>
   
               <h3>a bad wireframe renderer</h3>
               <iframe style="width: 500px; height: 542px; " src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/-OjU3K0fw"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This is a renderer I made one night because I thought this one would be different.
                  It was another bad attempt, as when objects go behind you, they continue to render.
                  I like the wireframe way this is made, but I wish you could actually move side to side,
                  instead of the way it currently works.

               <h3>starry night</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/kzyrWPjI3"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This is one of my favorite projects, mainly because of the night sky.
                  The daytime is cool I guess, but I don't really care about that too much.
                  Also because the day time could have been coded by my dog.
                  It is not difficult.
               </p>
   
               <h3>fading colors</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/ofwZmZPjL"></iframe>
               <p>
                     This is a simple, yet complex color changing screen. 
                     I really like this, because it forced me to learn specific details about how arrays work in JS.
                     It is also just pretty cool in my opinion.
               </p>
   
               <h3>corrupted vision</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/ZMSNOUSs_"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This is a project I made with a partner, so he told me a lot of what he wanted to do.
                  The shape colors change depending on the mouse position, some of them move, and the whole thing runs slowly.
               </p>
   
               <h3>stormy night</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/KN5_JqHGW"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This was version two of a project I had to make.
                  We were supposed to make a cloud float across the sky and have trees growing like I did.
                  I frogot to make the trees grow or to submit the assignment,
                  so I quickly duplicated my past assignment, added trees, and turned it in.
                  The storm isn't great, especially the first part where you can see the cloud, but I think it still looks cool.
               </p>
   
               <h3>a regular day</h3>
               <iframe style="width: 600px; height: 442px; " src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/4BuGTCXUu"></iframe>
               <p>
                  In this project we were supposed to make a backdrop and use emojis.
                  I skipped ahead and added clouds, and also made it so the monkey could hide in the forest.
                  I like this one, though it is very simple. It is calming.
               </p>
   
               <h3>staring cat</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/VOYJhCakQ"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This is an improved version of the first project I ever made in JS.
                  It is very simple, with a cat staring at you and moving its tail.
                  My teacher thought I cheated and used ChatGPT or something on this, but I did not.
               </p>
   
               <h3>colorful shapes</h3>
               <iframe class="embed" src="https://editor.p5js.org/oroe28/full/o-MyYCFhG"></iframe>
               <p>
                  This was just some project we did to get us to use variables.
                  It was also with a partner, and he wanted me to make it flash, so I did that.
